Upgrading Ruby
==============

How to upgrade the Ruby interpreter used by Scheduler.

Sometimes a new version of Scheduler will require a new version of
Ruby as well.  Ruby is an evolving language, and much work goes in
to adding new features, improving the speed and fixing security issues.

The Scheduler software aims to make use of a reasonably up-to-date
version of Ruby, whilst avoiding the bleeding edge.

When a new version of Scheduler becomes available, the release notes
will indicate whether it also requires a new version of Ruby.  This
is an unusual occurence, so the steps described here are not generally
needed.

.. note::

  Stick to the version of Ruby recommended by Scheduler.  Much testing
  is done to ensure compatibility, and whilst Scheduler itself is
  not terribly version sensitive, some of the supporting packages
  can be.

  The current recommended version of Ruby is 2.5.5, and the previous
  recommended one was 2.3.6.
