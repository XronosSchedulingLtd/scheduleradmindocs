Controlling resources
=====================

Concepts
--------

The working of Scheduler revolves around the concept of resources
attached to events.  It exists to record when any individual resource
is busy and when it is free.

These resources, can be people, places, or abstract things like
services or properties.

In a typical school, many resources are available on a first come, first
served basis.  The first teacher to schedule an event in a given classroom
gets it, and then to anyone coming along later it is busy.  No authorization
is needed.

For other resources though, a degree of control is needed.  Resources
which need control could be things like:

- The theatre
- The main public calendar
- The sport calendar
- The sports hall
- Audio-visual support
- Catering
- Cleaning

or anything else which the system administrator chooses.

The theatre may well have an administrator who handles bookings and
schedules resources around those bookings.

The main public calendar will certainly have at least one person
controlling it - people submit proposed events and then the controller
decides which ones can actually appear in the calendar.  Likewise
for the sport calendar, although it may well have a different
controller.

Audio-visual support may be provided by a particular individual.  He
or she will need to look at requests and decided which ones can be
fulfilled.

Catering and cleaning are potentially much more complex.  They will
probably need associated forms (also provided within Scheduler) and
perhaps account codes for the service to be charged to.

Some things can cope with only one booking at a time - the theatre
for instance - whilst others may be able to cope with several - e.g.
catering.  It's up to the resource administrator to decide what
is feasible.

Mention default resources which exist in the system to begin with.
