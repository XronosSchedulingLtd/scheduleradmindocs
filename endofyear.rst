End of year
===========

--------
MIS feed
--------

It is likely that your Scheduler installation takes a regular feed from
your school's main MIS (SchoolBase, iSAMS or WCBS/Pass) in order to keep
its idea of the timetable and teaching groups up to date.

Soon after the end of the academic year, the information in the MIS is
liable to enter a state of flux.  Firstly there will be some kind of
end-of-year processing within the MIS, ending one academic year and
starting another.  Then the person responsible for your school's
timetable will start entering the new one for the coming academic year,
and all the old teaching sets will be scrubbed (or promoted by a year)
and new ones created and populated.

There is no point in Scheduler fetching this data until it has stablized
at least a little.
